It contains a README.md file that explains what this repository contains and the languages used.
It mostly contains the **Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)** which helped made this google logo possible.
# Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
E.g.:
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}
# CSS Solved a Big Problem
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like **<FONT>**, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

We need proper knowledge of how the geometry is used on a webpage to understand how to implement geographical values and use arithmentical calculations to get the desired result.
