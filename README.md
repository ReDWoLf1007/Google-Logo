# Google-Logo
I've made Google logo design using **CSS** and a little help from youtube of course.
I've been diving deep into how to use CSS to better show a webpage and it's a slow walk but I'll eventually get there.
It's a sample of what CSS can do and make a web page stand out with unique design.
